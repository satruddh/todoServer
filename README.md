# ToDo App 
A simnple Todo App to add, manage and view todos. This project was developed as a skill develeopment and with learning oriented goals.

## Features
I have managed to add some simple functionality in this todo app such as-
- User specific Todos.
- Each user can perform basic CRUD operations on todos that they have created.
- User can not access todos of the other users
- Each todo has following attributes-
  - Todo Title
  - Todo Image ( I have used [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) for image functionality.)
  - A boolean flag to mark whether it is completed or not.
 
## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
